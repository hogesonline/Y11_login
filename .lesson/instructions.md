# Instructions  

**We're making a login function**

  _Once you do each step you need to write it in Pseudocode in your OneNote file_

  ## Steps
  1. Make a program that asks for a username and password and  prints "You are verified!" if the user enters "username" and "password" but "Try again" if these are not the entered username and password.
  2. Same program as a function instead of a whole program
  3. Alter the function so that the user gets 3 attempts to get the password correct.
  4. Use a list called *usernames* and a list called *passwords* to keep multiple logins and passwords.
  5. Use a file containing logins and passwords to verify the username and password (rather than something we have set manually)
  6. Make a new function to allow the user to register if they don't have a login and password already - store the login and password in the file
